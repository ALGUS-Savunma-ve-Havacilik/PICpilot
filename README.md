# Documentation

The PICpilot uses Doxygen to generate automatic API documentation of the code. You document code with special code blocks `/** **/`.

If you'd like to generate the documentation, you can run the upload-docs.sh script (preferably under linux). Make sure to actually 
install the doxygen and graphviz package first.
